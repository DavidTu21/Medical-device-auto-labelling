Label Generation
====

* Labelling is a regulatory requirement for the provision of medical devices.
* They are required to communicate identification of the device and how to use the device safely and effectively.
* Currently labels are generated in VBA for an A4 template that are printed on a standard laser printer.
* It is time-consuming to generate this label by hand written

`Aim: ` We designed a label with the required information that may easily printed by a label printer and this label will be automatically generated when the patients have filled in their information in another patient information sheet.
